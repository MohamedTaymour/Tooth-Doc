# Tooth-Doc
This is a mobile application project that I am working on and my colleagues, it aims to utilize Flutter's features to its fullest potential using 3D objects and intractability, an advanced encyclopedia, and expanding databases. The goal is to help early dentist students, people with bad dental health, and insightful people learn more.
