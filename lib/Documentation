1- The App went to a major change in direction, it went from being a simple tool to view a 3d model of teeth, gums and nerves
to a full on track tool for doctors, learning tool for students and a reference tool for normal users.

2- I added a Classes folder to contain the new ERD form of the application, each class is for the user and the features of the
Application

3- I've made a new Database system using xampp for the application, the database will be using MySQL for now and will be in
available for public once the first stages are done

4- The initial stages of the app will most likely remain the same, with the bottom navigation bar remaining the primary navigation
tool for the application, a drawer to be available for further options in the application and an account actions button to be the go
to for account management

5- The 3d Model for teeth will remain the most unique concept of the application and will remain a feature, including the ability to
interact with the teeth, the level of intractability is determined according to the status of the user (Patient, Student, Doctor)

6- The account section, done by Bikhet, will be changed in the following days, replacing the buttons made with a ListTitle for more
Aesthetic appeal

7- The newly introduced quiz system is an option which will be available in the future of the application, it aims to help all users
assess their performance in general questions about topics in dental field, the rating of the exams are shown every 20 quizzes averaging
them and placing a 5 star rating system accordingly
